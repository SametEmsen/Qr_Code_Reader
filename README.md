You can use this project for QR code scanning in your tests. 
All the necessary dependencies are included in the pom.xml file, 
especially those required for QR code reading, including 

"https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.zxing/core" 
and 
"https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.zxing/core "

It is ready for use, prepared in a singleton model in the TestNG format.

To customize it for your own project, you need to modify the
"configuration.properties" file by changing the URL where the QR code is located
and adjusting the necessary WebElement locators according to your project. 
The methods with the necessary explanations are provided within the classes.
